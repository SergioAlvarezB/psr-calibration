# Proper Scoring Rules for calibration.

This repo contains the code for reproducing the experiments of the paper.

## Set-up
I think we should updload a `requirements.txt` file and post in this section instructions on how to install them but also from where to download and where to place data, etc..

To do this we first must agree on the dependencies: Pytorch, Scipy, Numpy versions...


## Structure
Here I layout a possible structure for the repo, please feel free to completely change it. This is an uninformed guessed of what might be useful. If you already had anything in mind, or we feel the layout doesnt adapt to our needs is better to change it.

#### Folder Layout:

    psr-calibration\

    |----- utils.py
    |----- losses.py
    |----- metrics.py

## License
I guess we should add some license before making public the repo
